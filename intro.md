I've spent the last couple of weeks moving flats.  It was my third move in the last year, which is entirely too many. As all of us who have ever moved know, calling it a frustrating process can easily be an understatement. Besides packing up and taking stock of everything I own, I also had to physicaly get my posessions from one place to another. And once they were at my new place, I had to get them inside.  My new flat is great in many ways. It is the entire ground floor and contains a private back yard.  However, the doorway is narrow and includes a turn which proved to be a challange. So we took out the window and moved furniture in that way.

How many of us are taking out windows on a daily basis in order to accomlish taks?  By relying on outdated processes and tools, we are often forcing the contributors of our project to take out windows and sometimes worse to complete simple tasks. How often are you asking "What does it take to contribute to this project?"
